# Watcher: My best friend for finding local information

This is a project for CLPS1220B: Collective Cognition. I was curious about the ways that we could use the internet as a transactive memory system, specifically in relation to Vannevar Bush's [Memex](theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881) of having a read version where we could look through databases of information that applies to us instantly. Specifically, this piece from the [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-has-become-the-external-hard-drive-for-our-memories/) is what peaked this curiosity during the class.

## Applications to Collective Cognition

There's two main applications. The first is the fact that one of the views is that individuals who have effective memory recall are able to contribute more successfully to group projects. This can be seen in the fact that in meetings or other discussion based activities, individuals with notes / those who come prepared and have thought about what they're saying are more active contributors. Besides the direct idea into transactive memory systems, it also creates faster read access into someone else's brain. One of the fundamental problems in collective cognition is around cooperation and collaboration problems. This is even seen in crypto and other governance related issues but having quick speed into other people's notes/ideas/brain space can serve as a first step in solving this issue

## Details and Implementation

This is a static web app built with create-react-app and hosts a python library for creating an index of notes.
