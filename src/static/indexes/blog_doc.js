description of some of the biggest changes I experienced my freshman\n    year and why my friends are great\ndate: \"2019-06-25T21:41:34.088Z\"\nduration: 12 min\nprev:\nnext: college-friendship\n---\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I wrapped up my first year of college. It was a whirlwind of an adventure and went by waayyy too quickly, but I\u2019m super glad it happened. Freshman year, to say the least, was a lot. I learned that 9am classes are way harder to get up for than I initially thought (and 8:30am classes are actually the worst). I learned that motivating yourself to do work can also be really difficult, even if you have two midterms that week (woops\u2026welcome to Procrastination Station). But most importantly, I learned that the people you meet and become friends with is honestly one of the most impactful experiences you can have. I know that tons of people write about their transformation in college, how its the best four years, _yada yada yada\u2026_ but I wanted to tell a few stories that highlighted some of the most significant changes that happened in my life.\n\n### Finance and Why I Kinda Dropped\u00a0It\n\nGoing into Freshman year, I was pretty unsure about what I wanted to study. I knew that I liked math (at the time ahaha now pure math is the bane of my existence) and I knew that I liked application-based math. AP Econ in high school was one of my favorite classes (shoutout to Ms. Landau) and I definitely wanted to take more econ classes in college. As such, I decided to pursue a track in Brown\u2019s joint program in Computer Science and Economics. I ended up taking:\n\n-   Mathematical Microeconomics\n-   Multivariable Calculus\n-   Integrated Introduction to Computer Science\n-   ENGN 9 (if you know you know)\n\nGiven that my brother studied Finance and Accounting in college, I thought that I might give this route a try. And then, three things happened:\n\n1.  I took (dropped) Macroeconomics in the Spring. To say that I hated it is a bit\u00a0\u2026 underwhelming. The professor was disorganized, the class was large, and the work felt uneventful. Not only was the math not super relevant, but the equations derived in class were super meaningless. It was always \u201cbased on some assumption\u201d that we would inevitably disprove later. And so I was always questioning \u201cwhy would I take a class where the model that we use is wrong?\u201d So I dropped it. And my Econ major because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to get through that class without literally dragging myself through the mud and because I knew that I liked math enough that Applied Math was for sure an option. The switch was easy and I haven\u2019t looked back (yet). Plus with Brown\u2019s open curriculum, I have the opportunity to take whatever classes I want which has been the best thing so far.\n2.  I met with one of my friends, Jessica, who was also planning on majoring in computer science. We both came from Bellevue, WA and so we talked about transitioning and life both there and back home. I mentioned that I was potentially interested in banking and she asked if I read a book called _\u201cYoung Money\u201d by Kevin Roose._ I told her I hadn\u2019t and so later that day I got it on Kindle and started reading it. The book, a short documentary-style novel, follows six junior analysts as they make their way in the banking world. Some of them are at Goldman Sachs, some at Deutsche Bank, others at Bank of America. However, there was a main reoccurring theme: **They were all somewhat** **miserable.** And it was kind of depressing not going to lie. All these high-achieving youngsters getting their ambition and life sucked out of them for two years. Many of them wanted to quit, used psychedelics, and were unhappy with their life. Everything was about moving to the next step, the next rung on the corporate ladder, the next paycheck. And I realized I wasn\u2019t about that life. The book also mentioned that people who worked in Finance didn\u2019t really have any value add. All of their work was about fluctuating markets, figuring out prices, and selling literal tons of oil. I realized that I really enjoyed building things, whether tangible objects or products through coding, and that this lifestyle of managing money was not it. And, moreover, I liked interacting with people. Humans are naturally social creatures. And I want to tap into this innate love of people.\n3.  Math and CS happened. You know, that one subject that is universally hated. Yeah I started to like it (woops). Brown has one of the best Applied Math departments and I thought that having this opportunity to branch out (albeit slightly) was a chance I didn\u2019t want to miss. That, along with the fact that I was thoroughly enjoying my CS classes (and things that are happening in the industry/academia) means that I really didn\u2019t want to miss out on these opportunities.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve been extremely happy about it (one of my friends hasn\u2019t been and is jokingly pushing to go back towards economics). Will it change? Who knows honestly but I\u2019ve been quite content with where I\u2019ve been so far.\n\nI think this quote from the book sums up my feelings about the industry:\n\n> \u201cHe told the associate that there was a lot of economic value in the work the desk did\u200a\u2014\u200athat helping companies hedge their energy costs was a legitimate function of the capital markets, and that Goldman was the best place on the Street to do it. The associate took a moment to contemplate, then said, \u201cYou know, helping the world is great and all, but you need to be motivated by money.\u201d He\u2019d said it so bluntly that Jeremy attributed it to the booze, but the next day, as he came down from his hangover, he couldn\u2019t help but think that the associate might have been telling the truth.\u201d -Kevin Roose, \u201cYoung Money\u201d\n\n## Motivational Obstacles\n\nLike every other quintessential CS major out there, I attended a hackathon in the fall. Not only was it my first hackathon, but I also knew basically 0 useful languages (I knew functional languages hehe). But, ya know, I thought to myself, \u201c_It\u2019ll still be fine right? Not everyone who comes to these types of competitions knows how to code or is super technical.\u201d_ **Boyyyyyy, was I wrong haha**. EVERYONE WAS A LITTLE TOO PREPARED. There were people who:\n\n-   Brought their own hardware\n-   Walked around talking about their projects\n-   Threw around AI, Blockchain, ML, Deep Learning, and so many other things that I literally didn\u2019t understand\n-   Coded in wayyyyyy too many languages\n\nMeanwhile, I was just chilling there, very confused about what the entire heck was going on. I distinctly remember setting up the _Wix_ site, doing the good ol\u2019 drag-and-drop when my friend who I was on the team with me mentioned that he was having troubling with calling the function from the site and wanted to ask the _Wix_ mentor. Dutifully (and meekly because at this point I\u2019ve been doing my math homework which was super rough) I went up and asked the guy to help me. He directed me to their webpage which had instructions for this and proceeded to explain the code to me. At this point, I had no clue what the code was and sat their nodding literally SO CONFUSED about the entire thing and came back to the table. Needless to say, I did not hookup the website to our ML model. Or much else.\n\nThe entire hackathon made me question my decision to CS. The entire time, I remember messaging one of my friends about my entire crisis, going through all the stages of anxiety and hitting the fun wall that is imposter syndrome. I think I was stressed for two out of the three days and felt absolutely useless.\n\nI\u2019ve had this problem before. Impostor syndrome is super real in the CS world (and Brown and life). There are the kids who have been building apps since they were seven and you have kids like me who literally don\u2019t know what an API is or what the difference between front-end and back-end is. But in the same vein, it\u2019s motivational. I was sad as heck during the entire hackathon, questioned my entire major, but honestly came out of it more motivated to learn and improve my skills. As such, I decided to work on side projects, get more involved, and crush my CS classes. I haven\u2019t done the most revolutionary work, but I\u2019m getting there! Peep my website posted below which I just finished a week ago\u00a0:)\n\nBut yeah, moral of the story is college is a time to check yourself on where you currently stand but also motivate yourself to go further. This idea translates nicely into my last section which is\u2026\n\n## Friendships (or all relationships in\u00a0life)\n\nI want to start by saying that, hands-down, the friends you make in college are some of the best people you will ever meet. Everyone says it (because it\u2019s true). Everyone goes to college for the same reason\u200a\u2014\u200ato improve their craft, to learn more, to become better. And usually the college you\u2019re at is somewhat self-selected. People at Brown go to Brown because the open curriculum and all the opportunities it has to offer. As such, you meet some of the most talented and crazy people.\n\nFIRSTLY, I want to preface that all of the information below is my opinion. Take it with a grain of salt, take it with lots of salt. But yes, anyways\u2026\n\nCollege is **so short** that spending time with people you don\u2019t vibe with isn\u2019t worth it. _Seriously_. You shouldn\u2019t force yourself to hang out with people you don\u2019t like or don\u2019t vibe with. I had the fun (and unfortunate time) of living on the same floor with people that I didn\u2019t particularly vibe with and that these same people also hung out with some of my good friends. You might be thinking \u201cOh Ivan, what if you\u2019re just super biased and these people are actually good!\u201d And your point is super valid. I would illustrate a couple of short stories, but I think we should continue spreading positivity in our lives. So instead, you\u2019ll get some stories of why the friends that I\u2019ve found are some of the best and greatest people I\u2019ve ever met.\n\n### SHORT ASIDE\n\nFirst week of school/orientation week will be un-fun, stressful, and kind of sad for everyone. There will be those kids who you see flocking around in large groups. You might vibe with them, you might not. Who knows. I definitely didn\u2019t for sure. I remember the first week, I struggled with like five different things: being away from home, having a roommate, not knowing anybody, impostor syndrome, and the fact that I got off the wait-list. I know, everyone always says \u201coh you\u2019re here now!\u201d but the fact that a college had to look at me twice before they were like \u201cwelp, fuck it\u201d is a bit disheartening. That, combined with a super rough college app season made me question my already dwindling self-esteem.\n\nSo that first week, I tried my best to extroverted. I tried to talk to everyone, introduce myself, join in conversations, all that good stuff. It\u2019s really hard, especially if you\u2019ve never done that before. Eventually I got burnt out and just wanted to sleep. I ate alone for the first couple of days, didn\u2019t really do much, and just tried to figure out factors that I could control (like my schedule).\n\nI think my favorite part is the fact that I met some of my friends at this random orientation event. I just stumbled in on their conversation and they were all like \u201cyo we\u2019re all pretty cool let\u2019s hang out again!\u201d And then it just\u2026happened. I thought I would never see most of them again (literally I have so many phone numbers from people I\u2019ve met once) but here we are, a full year later with so many dumb photos, memories, and weekends that I\u2019m so appreciative of. I guess the moral of this aside is that you _will find_ people that you vibe with, care about, and love to hang out with. Just give it a moment. And never doubt that you\u2019re at the wrong spot. Just give it a semester.\n\nBack to your regularly scheduled stories of my struggles and how my friends are great.\n\n1.  **Support**\n\nCollege is a tough time. Everyone knows that. Freshman year is especially rough because of transitions, classes, finding new friends, developing your own schedule, developing your own life, finding out who you are, having impostor syndrome hit hard, rinse and repeat.\n\nI had a pretty regimented high school schedule. I would go to school from 8:30\u20133:30, either go to a club for an hour, go to golf for two hours (or both), go home, eat dinner, do homework until who knows when, and then finally, sleep. Coming into college, I knew that my schedule would fluctuate. A lot. And so, having friends that were flexible (aka I\u2019m really sorry that I\u2019m late all the time) and actually cared about meeting up with me was really helpful. Not only did they reach out whenever I needed it, but the fact that I could count of them, even if I was just doing my own work, was such a safe feeling to have.\n\nThe fact that every weekend, we always hung out and that we have a group chat that people responded to and are so open with each other is heartening. I never had this kind of relationships with my friends back home and it was such a nice change of pace.\n\nAlso if you know, you know (#Shine)\n\n2. **LMAO CS**\n\nThis one is just a short and funny story (in retrospect) but during second semester of my intro CS sequence, my code for one of the homeworks decided to spontaneously combust and disappear. \u201cNice\u201d I thought, there goes three days of work. I was also waiting a couple hours for a TA to help me with my assignment and I distinctly remember just staring blankly at the TA as he walked over. I just said \u201cmy code just deleted itself.\u201d (he was just as confused as I was). Didn\u2019t really do much, sat in the chair, called a couple of people, almost had a mental breakdown.\n\nAfter I finally redid the entire assignment, it wasn\u2019t working. There was some small piece that was off that I had working earlier and I just couldn\u2019t fix it. At this point, I was super tired, had stared a screen for too long, and was just about done. I called two of my friends in the class (it was around midnight) and they came over, looked at my code, fixed it, and honestly got me through the night. If it hadn\u2019t been for them (and literally every other time), I think I would\u2019ve failed my CS classes the past two semesters.\n\nI guess I just want to end off with saying that the main thing I learned that I still say to this day is that relationships (both friendships and actual relationships) are really a two-way street. Both parties have to care, put time in, and genuinely like the other person. This builds healthy bonds and friendships where everyone is open with each other, recognizes when the other is feeling down, and makes a commitment to the other person. Actual relationships are the same probably, just haven\u2019t experienced that one yet lmao.\n\n#### Concluding Thoughts\n\nFreshman year has been fun and I\u2019v really enjoyed it. I\u2019m excited for all the new prospects to come in the future and I don\u2019t want college to end\u00a0:( Never have I met such a talented group of people that I can\u2019t wait to see what they end up doing and am grateful to call them my friends \u2764.\n\nAlso...dogs\n\n**_Thank you so much for reading.

Not only was it an amazing experience for someone who has had little to no design experience, but I also had the opportunity to meet some extremely talented and creative people. If you\u2019re ever in Boston or near the Boston area, I highly recommend checking them out. They\u2019re super cool, work on amazing projects, and are constantly at the forefront of innovation. The thing was, after their entire case brief and the steps they made us go through in the design process, I had a deja vu moment to middle school Ivan where he competed in a small competition called Future Problem Solving ([fpspi.org](http://fpspi.org) if you want to check them out). As such, I realized that although design thinking and designing seemed like it was this lofty concept that people who spend their lives analyzing and being creative have the skillset to do, anyone can honestly do it.\n\n## So what?\n\nYou might be thinking, _why should I care?_ I\u2019ll tell you exactly why through an anecdotal story. During a planning meeting I had for the tech team in our entrepreneurship club, we were discussing ways in which we wanted to revamp our website. Although minimalist and sleek, it was a little bland, underused, and rarely updated. The result was, people on the team wanted to update it, add some more features, and completely redesign the look of it. However, when I thought about it a little more, it felt that we were missing the fundamental point:\n\n> What\u2019s the point in designing a website that no one uses in the first place\n\nThe purpose of design is to be in the minds of the user, conceptualize what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re looking for, and then find the best ways to solve the habits they have. It\u2019s less about what you want, and more about what you should be doing to help these people. If you\u2019re really trying to find the best solution, you should constantly be doing research: user testing, user personas, talking to actual people, figuring out what people want. It doesn\u2019t make sense to use only your own experiences and circumstances to design something.\n\nAnyways, I took the same intuition that I brought with me to IDEO and brought our scope back into question. The group agreed, and we shifted gears slightly to figure out the best ways to provide the Brown EP site as a resource.\n\n## What it means to\u00a0design\n\nIt means whatever you want it to be. Design is about improving experiences. It\u2019s about improving situations. It\u2019s about solving problems that exist. It should be user focused and it should be grounded in research. We as humans do this every day. We figure out problems in our routines. We use productivity apps to manage our lives. We use calendars to keep track of our day. If we want to fix something, we structure it in our lives. Everyone has this innate capacity, you just need something to bring it out.\n", "title": "designer", "href": "https://ivanzhao.me/writing/designer"}, {"id": "ww2", "tokens": {"title": 1, "a": 24,

It\u2019s hard to be introspective, to realize that at the end of the day, we are all humans making our way in this world. I guess I was feeling sentimental and a bit emotional, but in honor of National Coming Out Day, here\u2019s an essay I wrote for a queer scholarship I applied to. Although I didn\u2019t end up qualifying, it meant a lot for me to process these emotions and get them down. I hope it helps someone out there.\n\n## Essay\n\nI flopped on my bed at 5pm that Sunday, exhausted, sweaty, delirious. It was the Sunday after we had just been kicked off campus for coronavirus protection procedures. I had spent the day moving boxes, driving between houses, and picking up various people. Given that Brown moved up the date that we had to leave by, I felt both emotionally and physically overwhelmed. Nevertheless, I remained steadfast and calm, dutifully carrying out the tasks that my friends had asked me to do.\n\nOver the past couple of years, I constantly struggled with being okay with myself (and what being okay really meant). Growing up in a family that valued discipline and respect meant that I was constantly being beaten for any form of \u201cbacktalk\u201d or conversations where I stood up for myself. In having these constant interactions where certain ideals were forcibly ingrained into my head, it resulted in me shifting towards the extreme opposite: supporting others to an extent that is detrimental to my own health. Or in other words, being taken advantage of.\n\nUpon first glance, it should\u2019ve been obvious. Constantly being physically, emotionally, and verbally abused resulted in a tendency towards doing actions that pleased other people. I first realized that I had this tendency during my time in high school when I was one of the first of my friends with a driver\u2019s license. People frequently asked me for rides and I always replied that it was no big deal, that\u2019s what friend are for. But as it became more of a recurring task, and as I realized that I was sacrificing hours of my time to drive to places far out of the way for me, I started feeling a bit undervalued and underappreciated. \u201cNonsense,\u201d I thought to myself. These were things that friends do for each other. They help them out. But the notion still lingered.\n\nFast forward to my first couple years in college and I was determined to change myself from high school. Become a better person, a better friend, and a better student. I wanted to find lasting friendships, the kind where people push you to be better, inspire you to go further. And while I did find those, I also found myself constantly back in the same rut, lending clothes out, offering to bike to a nearby grocery store to get cake, hosting events in my room and cleaning up the next day. I cherished the time I spent with my friends (and also the memories we made), but it felt like the things that I did were sometimes out of my own scope. I would prioritize cake purchases over my homework, justifying that the delight my friend felt would be worth whatever points I missed. I lost hours of sleep because I was hanging out with friends, telling myself that these moments were important. And from these constant interactions, I finally confirmed a fear for myself: I desperately want to be loved.\n\nTelling yourself this is pretty difficult. From a basic needs standpoint, everyone desires love and affection. Human beings are inherently social creatures. From our hunter-gatherer ancestors, we moved as a society and grew up with others. As a queer Asian, I find it extremely hard to fit in within a group. On one hand, I am the poster child, a hard-working student turned software engineer who\u2019s making it in the world and acknowledging the sacrifices his parents had to face to get here. But constantly, I feel lost and alone. The amount of representation in the queer Asian community is tiny, and it\u2019s hard to place yourself in a world with little to no role models. Sometimes, I wonder whether pursuing a relationship would help fill this need to be loved. But I\u2019ve slowly learned that relationships aren\u2019t necessarily a solution to this, it\u2019s to find my own place in the world.\n\nDuring this period of quarantine, I\u2019ve been been able to come more to terms with my own self and my own identity. I\u2019ve done a better job of accepting my place in the world, that I am worth being loved, and that I have this support system of friends who do care about me. While confronting my own deepest desire was painful and heartbreaking at first, it\u2019s allowed me to be optimistic and reprioritize my life. I\u2019ve been able to set goals on what accomplishments I want to hit, activities I want to do, memories I want to make. And maybe this loneliness will be satisfied by some man who decides to spend the rest of their life with me. Wherever it comes from, I want to be ready for it.\n", "title": "loved", "href": "https://ivanzhao.me/writing/loved"}, {"id": "ww3", "tokens": {"title": 1, "a": 38, "short": 2, "dive": 1, "into": 2,

with me\ndate: \"2020-07-04T06:04:26.887Z\"\nduration: 7 min\nprev: \"designer\"\nnext: \"loved\"\n---\n\nThe travel, tourism, and hospitality industry has been extremely hard to define. With the growth of giants such as Airbnb and Expedia, which allow a one-stop shop for all your travel needs, it has become increasingly easier for individuals themselves to book their own trips, rather than using traditional methods. In 2019, travel and tourism alone contributed approximately [2.9 trillion dollars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/233223/travel-and-tourism--total-economic-contribution-worldwide/) to GDP in the U.S. Additionally, the U.S. leads the world in international travel and tourism exports and ranks third in terms of total visitation. However, the current industry leaders for the technical side of distribution aren\u2019t adapting to the new technology. That, tacked on with COVID\u2019s prevention of normal travel, means that airlines are scrambling to cut costs, increase cashflow, and adopt new technologies and ideas more rapidly. So what does this mean for the travel industry? In order to understand this, it\u2019s important to first consider two things: current trends in the travel startup ecosystem and changes being made in the travel industry.\n\nIn the past decade, there have been a few unicorns that have modeled their company around creating infrastructure for developers to do their jobs easier. Stripe, Plaid, and Twilio, just to name a few, are all companies that have been extremely successful and have grown rapidly in this space. Their API service provides ease of use for developers creating software around payments and texting, allowing those users to easily scale their own product as their user base grows. So it\u2019s no surprise that this business model/idea spread to other industries that lagged behind. Specifically, the process of booking a ticket.\n\n### A Little Bit of Travel\u00a0History\n\nIn order to understand what motivates companies to build software infrastructure for travel, we need to break down the history of travelling a little bit. Say you\u2019re a traveler who\u2019s interested in flying from Chicago to Miami. During the pre-covid era, this task would have been extremely simple. Go to Google, type in \u201cflights from Chicago to Miami,\u201d and bam! You have a wide array of flights to choose from with built in functionality to compare dates. In fact, the concept of a [frictionless travel experience](https://newsroom.expedia.com/2019-11-13-Research-Shows-Reducing-Friction-Matters-Expedia-Group-Prioritizes-for-Travelers-and-Partners) was one of Expedia\u2019s main value props that they provided to travelers hungry for adventure. The old segmented platforms made it extremely difficult for a user to go through the entire process and book a ticket seamlessly.\n\nBefore these travel booking services even existed, if people wanted to book a flight, they would go directly to an airline or a travel agent and discuss potential options. The travel agent would find a physical copy of the flight\u2019s availability through an actual, physical ticket that they would punch. Naturally, as travel became increasingly popular, this process became increasingly harder to scale. There were problems in quality assurance and the entire process inconvenienced everyone involved. This is where GDS, otherwise known as [Global Distribution Systems](https://traveldatacollective.com/insights/your-guide-to-global-distribution-systems-gds), comes in. Essentially, airlines started using GDS decades ago as technology started advancing to all industries, rather than focusing on problems just in computing. American Airlines, along with IBM, created SABRE (Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment), which allowed users to enter data, process requests, and create a more comprehensive and robust system for people to actually use.\n\nNow that we actually have this system, what does it mean for airlines? Each individual airline can now attach their inventory and seats into this massive system. At the time, this was amazing, especially since the growth of the internet and an increase in online booking tools meant that people were able to book flights from the comfort of their own home. But looking at the current GDS market, it\u2019s interesting to note that the main source of revenue comes from distribution. Take Amadeus, for example, one of the largest companies currently involved in the GDS space. Approximately [65% of their revenue comes from distribution fees](https://books.google.com/books?id=HJWHDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=65%25+of+airline+revenue+comes+from+distribution+fees&source=bl&ots=yOTZQxB55p&sig=ACfU3U21rQaIIxUSzt0NV-9JKVhnJZSR9w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNs4jmlK7qAhV3FTQIHRupARgQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ), usually a result of querying, hike up on prices, and other hidden fees as a way to profit off of companies using GDS software.\n\nThis reveals the main problem with this service\u200a\u2014\u200ait passes off most of the costs to the consumer as a result of hidden fees, similar in a way to Ticketmaster or other ticket selling platforms. European airlines have especially been the most active over the last few years in finding different ways to foster distribution capacities. For example, companies like Lufthansa have placed a surcharge of about $16 on transactions made through the GDS system (which doubles to $32 dollars with a flight with one connection). British Airways employed a similar tactic on bookings made through large GDS services such as [Sabre](http://sabre.com/), [Amadeus](https://amadeus.com/en) or [Travelport](https://www.travelport.com/). Given the number of tickets that people are buying (either through connections or round trip flights), it makes sense that one way to increase airlines revenue streams is to decrease the cost of using this platform. If they could somehow find a new way to navigate this problem, every user involved in the purchasing process would have a better experience.\n\n### Introducing NDC\n\n![](img/0__jY41liQiG4EVapip.jpg)\n\nNDC (New Distribution Capability) is exactly the way in which airlines have avoided using GDS. It primarily uses an XML schema (similar to HTML, the language that makes up this browser) in order to pass information between airlines and potentially interested customers. But most importantly, it allows for selling ancillary products like seat upgrades through its more robust data transfer and updated technology. This is significant because over over the past decade, the ancillary market has grown rapidly as a result of airlines needing to use these third party platforms and find other ways to adjust to the growing demands and problems that GDS forced them to deal with. Therefore, by completing more of these transactions directly, airlines can decrease their costs of production.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping people from changing and implementing NDC enabled services? As of now, there are currently [62](https://traveldatacollective.com/insights/what-is-the-new-distribution-capability-ndc#:~:text=NDC%20was%20orginally%20created%20as,capabilities%20as%20an%20airline%27s%20website.) airlines that are either NDC certified or XML-capable. This is because many airlines haven\u2019t been able to adapt their technology in order to keep up with the rapid advancements made by smaller startups in this area such as [Duffel](https://duffel.com/), [Farelogix](https://www.farelogix.com/), or [Paxport](https://www.paxport.com/). As of now, the total impact that NDC will have on the market is uncertain. Since NDC has the capability of adding features like purchasing seats, upgrades, meals, and car rentals (which previously limited GDS) and also has the capacity to provide external API\u2019s for developers, this is an exciting time for all relevant companies ready to make waves. Whether that\u2019s through integrating with chatbots to provide higher levels of support or bundling products together, startups and other tech companies are prepared to make changes to the status quo of how airlines are running a fundamental aspect of their business.\n\n### COVID\n\nA short note on COVID, given its relevance and impact on the travel industry. The World Travel and Tourism Council projects a global loss of [7 million jobs and $2.1 trillion in revenue](https://wttc.org/News-Article/WTTC-now-estimates-over-100-million-jobs-losses-in-the-Travel-&-Tourism-sector-and-alerts-G20-countries-to-the-scale-of-the-crisis). From this chart on the left provided by National Geographic, it\u2019s easy to see that COVID has resulted in a drastic change in how people travel around the world. It has made them [book less tickets, cancel vacations, or just stop traveling altogether](https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-week/travel-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/). However, although COVID has forced people to avoid travel as much as possible, travel has become a fundamental aspect of the modern human. We enjoy the opportunity to be whisked away from one place to another, visiting new countries, new places, and new cultures in the blink of an eye (at least, if you sleep on the plane). Although COVID has stopped current travel, this seems to be a perfect opportunity for the travel industry (and airlines especially) to optimize their own operations and run a leaner business with a higher cash-flow. With all the talks of going fully remote (Congress is even thinking of transitioning to [Zoom](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/is-the-future-of-congress-on-zoom.html)), it makes sense that a lot of industries and aspects of society have accelerated a decade towards the future, where people are able to do whatever they want digitally. However, what people are forgetting is that exploring, travelling, and being together defines human nature. Thus, although some activities will shift online forever, the travel industry will come back.\n\n### Concluding Thoughts\n\nI\u2019m personally super excited to see how Duffel and other startups in this space will innovate the travel industry. Business traveler focused companies, such as [Lola](https://www.lola.com/) or [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/), have also become more prominent within the last couple years and have pivoted to becoming an aggregator for travel tools. We\u2019ve seen numerous software infrastructure startups become extremely successful by fixing and creating solutions to old problems that developers struggled to find solutions for. Given that technology is constantly changing and adapting every day, it\u2019s surprising to see these large airline distribution aggregators such as Sabre and Amadeus fail to actually make waves. I have no doubt that one of these startups will become the new platform that all airlines integrate with, given how easy it is to integrate a new API or platform on their server.\n", "title":

'2021-04-13T04:06:45Z'\nduration: 7 min\nprev: on-2020\nnext:\n---\n\n_Originally posted on the [Reboot Newsletter](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/venture)_\n\nHop on Twitter any day of the week and you\u2019ll probably see a four-letter monosyllabic word raising a round on a $4B valuation. You might think, \u201cThere\u2019s no way this app is worth four billion dollars, especially if they\u2019re not making any money.\u201d Before I got into venture and startups, I was right there with you (and honestly still am).\n\nI dipped my toes into the startup world after speaking with Seattle-based founders for a small high school research project. As a student with zero clue what he wanted to do in life, it was invigorating to be in an ecosystem where people were motivated by the personal drive to build a better future, and I knew I wanted to do something similar. In college, I joined the team at [Dorm Room Fund](http://dormroomfund.com/) (DRF), a student-run VC fund backed by First Round Capital that has funded over 260 startups over the past decade. At DRF, I\u2019ve been able to talk with founders at the earliest stages of their business and been given the power to make investment decisions.\n\nI was also entering a world that, as a queer Asian, wasn\u2019t the most welcoming. There\u2019s a ton of impostor syndrome that comes from the feeling of not having enough experience, and when you\u2019re arguing with straight, white, cis, able-bodied men about whether companies focused on STD testing for queer people are too \u201cniche\u201d of a market, it becomes clear that the products getting funded are propagating preexisting systems of power.  \nAs such, it\u2019s up to us to rethink how VC operates as a system. Silicon Valley touts a motto of \u201cmoving fast and breaking things.\u201d Instead, I argue that the industry should focus on \u201cmoving forward and backing things.\u201d\n\n## on doing diligence\n\nIf we\u2019re creating a better world through venture investing, we must hold ourselves to a higher standard. The question therefore becomes: how do we design an ethical framework that integrates with our current due diligence process?\n\nOne idea, speculative design, is inspired by speculative fiction. Speculative design addresses big societal issues with design processes and seeks to imagine/what ifs/. In Ivica Mitrovic\u2019s [Intro to Speculative Design Practice](http://speculative.hr/en/introduction-to-speculative-design-practice/) , he states that \u201cby speculating, designers re-think alternative products, systems and worlds.\u201d Designer and teacher James Auger [says that speculative design](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14626268.2013.767276) (1) moves away from the constraints of the commercial practice; (2) uses fiction to speculates on future products, services, systems and worlds, examining the impact of new technologies on everyday life; (3) and initiates dialogue between experts (scientists, engineers and designers) and users of new technologies (the audience).\nIf we take Uber as a case study, early investors were excited about the prospect of expanded mobility. However, what they failed to consider, and what could\u2019ve been discussed through speculative design, is what the world would look like once Uber scaled. What would happen to taxi drivers? What we\u2019d see is that in an industry where [over a quarter of taxi drivers/chauffeurs are Black](https://datausa.io/profile/soc/taxi-drivers-chauffeurs#demographics) , Uber\u2019s \u201cdisruption\u201d would take money from the pockets of marginalized communities and instead line their own.\n\nOne might look at this example and say that it\u2019s easier to criticize a company retroactively than it is to anticipate problems in advance. To illustrate how speculative design might be used to evaluate an up-and-coming company, consider the increasingly popular [live audio chat spaces](https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-audio/) . On top of accessibility considerations for the [Deaf community](https://limpingchicken.com/2021/01/29/liam-odell-clubhouse-vs-twitter-spaces-social-medias-move-towards-audio-and-what-this-means-for-deaf-people/) , one question an investor could ask during a chat with a social audio founder is about moderation \u2014 for instance, how does the founder plan to deal with the potential for deepfaked audio recordings? For an early stage company, it\u2019s too early to expect a detailed response, but hearing how the founder approaches this question could provide insight to how they think about building usable products more broadly.\nThe other key question that investors should consider during the diligence process is whether a product should exist in the first place. What are all the ways the creation of this good or service could affect different people and communities? Keeping in mind this range of positive and negative scenarios, is the world where this product exists a world that you want to live in?\n\nOne space that has been extremely popular recently is blockchain, with applications ranging from [DeFi](https://fei.money/) to [MMORPGs](https://zkga.me/) . Understanding the hype around blockchain requires exploring it through a speculative lens: people are excited about DeFi because a peer-to-peer financial system would circumvent outdated, slow, or restrictive banking bureaucracy. In a world where peer-to-peer protocols are the default, sending money to friends and family would be far simpler, though financial crimes and illicit content markets might be harder to track and shut down. Simultaneously, speculative design can be a tool to imagine alternative solutions to the same root problems: how else might we promote financial accessibility: especially across borders, for sex workers, or for people living under authoritarian surveillance states? In addition to technology, what social and political arrangements might support this future?\n\n## on (who\u2019s) backing things\n\nIt\u2019s blatantly obvious that tech and venture is still a rich white man\u2019s game, and many new products aren\u2019t built with marginalized communities in mind. Consider [Slack\u2019s new feature which lets users DM (or harass) anyone](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348126/slack-connect-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature) or [Intel\u2019s sound mixer that lets you turn up and down different types of hate speech](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373290/intel-bleep-ai-powered-abuse-toxicity-gaming-filters) . Meanwhile, diverse and underestimated founders are building [inclusive](https://healthyrootsdolls.com/) [products](https://joindaylight.com/) and products that [center the needs](https://www.folxhealth.com/) of marginalized communities. These founders are on the path to create a better future, something that VC should be backing more.\nHowever, [recent funding reports ](https://allraise.org/assets/all-raise-annual-report-2020.pdf) say otherwise. In 2020, Black women were the fastest growing group of entrepreneurs in the country, yet received only 0.27% of VC funding. That\u2019s because startups are a lopsided marketplace where investors have all the decision-making power. Given that [58% of all VCs are white men](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethedwards/2021/02/24/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks/) , we\u2019re left with an industry that thinks that [machine-powered juices](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/01/juicero-silicon-valley-shutting-down) are the future.\nUntil we reach a point where the demographics of founders are reflected in the investors they\u2019re pitching, we need to hold both sides of the market to a higher standard. Investors, especially those with decision-making power should back a diverse set of founders, especially those from underrepresented and underestimated backgrounds. Simultaneously, founders should aim to diversify their cap table, and can use matching tools such as [Lolita Taub\u2019s](https://twitter.com/lolitataub/status/1392519437266432005) . As part of DRF, I\u2019m excited to launch the [Prism](https://prism.dormroomfund.com/) Investor Track, which focuses on nurturing LGBTQ+ investors. But as long as most investors keep \u201cpattern matching\u201d to support the same type of founders, we\u2019ll continue to see predatory startups that take advantage of marginalized groups as they grow at \u201call costs.\u201d\n\n## on the path forward\n\nFor all its glory and attention, VC isn\u2019t a perfect investment vehicle for every business, and certainly not for every social problem. At the same time, VC can\u2019t be ignored. Given that returns in [VC represent 21% of US GDP](https://www.brookings.edu/research/as-the-venture-capital-game-gets-bigger-the-midwest-keeps-missing-out/#footnote-1) , we need more investors who are women, Asian, Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities, and /especially/those that sit at the intersection of multiple affinity groups to participate in and transform the ecosystem.\nFor founders and investors who feel that this industry isn\u2019t built for you, /it really isn\u2019t./But I\u2019m optimistic about a new wave of technologists, founders, and investors who are centering marginalized voices and thinking about the communities that we\u2019re building for. We can support each other in taking VC back. Therefore, I highly recommend finding a community or a peer group that you can lean on. If you\u2019re looking for groups, Gefen\u2019s [Bunch of Founders](https://bunchoffounders.com/) is fantastic; and [Lolita](https://twitter.com/lolitataub) , [Mac](https://twitter.com/macconwell?lang=en) , and [Elizabeth](https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33) , all tweet advice based on their personal experiences. If you\u2019re currently a student, DRF provides [summer tracks](https://dormroomfund.com/opportunities) just for you. We\u2019re here to help \u2014 seriously.\nAt the end of the day, I want people to recognize that venture capital cannot be divorced from the policies, people, and societies that it affects. Thus, the people who inhabit and build it cannot be either.\n", "title": "ethical-vc", "href": "https://ivanzhao.me/writing/ethical-vc"}, {"id": "ww5", "tokens": {"title": 1, "how": 4, "moving": 3,

It\u2019s the first time that many of us go out into the world, sometimes on the other side of the country (or globe) without our family, without our friends, and without the home that we grew up in. It\u2019s a weird transition for sure, but today I want to focus on one aspect of my life that\u2019s changed dynamically: friendship and its inherent value.\n\n#### Middle School\n\nAhhh the awkward phase that no one wants to remember. I know I truly don\u2019t want to remember (and simply have blocked it out of my life). Middle School was the time where you go through various things: figuring out what feelings are, figuring out why you\u2019re getting taller, and figuring out what to do with yourself. I remember my friendships during the time were people that I shared classes with. They didn\u2019t really mean much, moreso out of convenience rather than any true value. And I think at that time, it was fine. I was too overwhelmed with trying not to fail my classes, balance the extracurriculars I was thinking about doing, and dealing with that good ol\u2019 family life. It was a time. It existed, and that\u2019s basically all I have to say about middle school.\n\n#### High School\n\nEntering high school was a legitimate struggle for me. I switched schools to my local high school instead of going to the one that was slightly further. It was that awkward transition period where you didn\u2019t know anyone, was too scared to talk to new people, and just got through classes. During my Freshman year, it took a toll on my self-esteem. At that point, I relied on external validation in my life to keep me going. However, I got bullied to some extent and generally had a poor self-image. It took me a while to realize that the people I called \u201cfriends\u201d during my Freshman year were actively contributing to that and I shouldn\u2019t have hung out with them if that was the case.\n\n> _Lesson #1 (This one\u2019s pretty obvious but): People who actively hurt you aren\u2019t worth spending the time on. Life is too short to spend time with people who aren\u2019t willing to invest time, effort, and respect into the friendship._\n\nDuring my Sophomore year, I ended up becoming friends with a different group of people who I started hanging out after one of them randomly texted me about going to the movies. Not only was this weird (I didn\u2019t really go to the movies and I didn\u2019t really hang out with friends outside of school), but it was the first case in which someone I know reached out to me, rather then me pestering someone else. It felt nice, that someone else cared enough to reach out to me. From then on, I hung out with this new group of friends. It was weird that I had a group of friends to hang out with constantly for lunch, go to dinner, or watch movies with. I didn\u2019t really understand what this meant, but I felt somewhat connected and somewhat involved. This was the first couple of times that I stayed up to 3am talking to someone about calculus problems, problems about social situations and navigating high school, and getting through the week. I never knew that having board game night on the weekends was a thing, and that I could sleepover at friend\u2019s houses. It was a different experience for me, and I was so thankful to be able to experience it.\n\n> _Lesson #2: People will reach out to you if they want to hang out with you. I say this a lot but relationships are a two way street. Get friends who care about you._\n\nLast short story from high school: This same group of friends ended up changing and forming in different ways. People came and went. The groups were constantly in flux. It was a natural progression of course. Like myself, other people did some self-reflection, reevaluated what they wanted in life, and realized that the group they were with wasn\u2019t a good fit. Maybe it was a couple of the people, maybe it was the entire dynamic, or maybe they just didn\u2019t vibe.\n\nDuring my senior year, one of the girls that I was pretty close with throughout sophomore year and halfway through junior year put a strain on our friendship. It became toxic on both sides. She constantly felt the need to flex her intelligence and superiority. Everything I said was met with either a rebuttal or a \u201coh I did this today\u201d. Eventually, the conversations themselves didn\u2019t feel meaningful, didn\u2019t really add worth. She didn\u2019t care about my friends, and was mad whenever I would hang out with them. And then, it was gone\u2026\n\nI think its better for both of us, but it made me think about what kind of friend I wanted to be, and what kind of person I aspired to be. From this, I realized, that being a friend means you should be **supportive, caring, and understanding**. Your wins are everyone\u2019s wins, and you shouldn\u2019t be envious that someone else is thriving. That being said, friends should also check in with each other, care about each other\u2019s well being, and ensure that everything is going alright.\n\n#### College\n\n_I guess this is probably where I should\u2019ve started this article but oh well. I need to improve my organization haha. But I digress._\n\nCollege has honestly been one of the most trying, transformative, difficult times in my life. The highs are super high, and the lows hit hard. I\u2019ve hung out with friends on the weekend, taken a trip up to Vermont, and also lived in the CIT through the entire week. Classes take up less time, extracurriculars take up more time, and work takes up an absurd amount of time. But in it all, the thing I learned the most is that it\u2019s always important to make time for your friends.\n\nI stand by the statement that no matter how busy someone is, if they prioritize their time correctly, you\u2019ll always be able to have some time to spend with your friends. It\u2019s just about how highly you value that time. And in college, I realized much I value the time spent with friends. Yes, I say I\u2019m an introvert and I need that space to myself, but having friends that celebrate life, get lunch, and hang out with you is one of the greatest things being a human has. So embrace it.\n\n> _Lesson #3: Make time for your friends. Check in on them, get lunch with them, and make sure they\u2019re getting sun/water (basically they\u2019re a plant)_\n\nThe last thing I learned in college is how much I value friendships that have depth to them. Yes getting meals and hanging out/studying is important, but I think it\u2019s equally if not more important to be open about problems, experiences, or life in general. This inherently ties back to my idea about having supporting friends, because in order for friends to support you, they need to know what you\u2019re about, what you want to do in life, your biggest fears (_so that maybe they can help you overcome them_), and your biggest dreams (_so that maybe they can help you achieve them_). Taking the time to understand your friends deeply is important. So have that 3am conversation about why you\u2019re struggling through classes, or why you\u2019re scared for the future, or why that interaction last week made you happy. We\u2019re all humans. We should share and treasure ourselves, our feelings, but also others that we care about. It\u2019s a basic human necessity. So let\u2019s spread it.\n\n_If you\u2019re reading this, that means you made it to the end of this long, weird, and poorly organized article about friends. It\u2019s because I\u2019ve been going through an interesting development my Sophomore year and wanted to document it somewhere briefly. If you enjoyed it, give me some claps or a follow, it would mean a lot._\n", "title": "college-friendship", "href": "https://ivanzhao.me/writing/college-friendship"}, {"id": "ww6", "tokens": {"title":

'2021-01-01T11:23:13.041Z'\nduration: 4 min\nprev: 'loved'\nnext: 'ethical-vc'\n---\n\nThe year passed by in a blur (just like the quality of this photo but I love it anyways). I remember back at the start of 2020, my friends and I crowded around in a tiny dorm room, sipping on wine and thinking about the future of sophomore year and wondering what exactly was going to happen. I had a rough fall internship recruiting period, some of the strongest anxiety I\u2019ve ever had, and general self-doubt.\n\nMy friends and I ended up reviewing some of the goals I set for 2020, which are listed below:\n\n1.  Get a job (and adjacently, stop comparing myself to my friends, peers, and those in industry)\n2.  Spend more time on the things that matter, including friendships, family, and hobbies\n3.  Relationship (with like 50 question marks)\n\nIn a rough sketch, I did the first one (and it\u2019s corollary to an extent), definitely did the second one, and the third one we gave it a [good ol\u2019 college try](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=old%20college%20try). But what I think it does is paint three broad strokes that affected my life on a day to day manner. As a sort of reflection/journal/rant I have some notes down below in the hopes that maybe, something here resonates with you.\n\n### On Career\n\nThis year I worked two jobs, one I loved but ended up being forced to drop due to covid and the other that I absolutely hated. I realized that what I loved about startups is the freedom it gives you to pursue in sort of whatever direction you desire, but also constrains you to REALLY focus on users. And I mean it. Which I personally love as someone who\u2019s extremely passionate about user experience, psychology, and consumer behavior but is not necessarily true for everyone. I also ran a fireside series focused on LGBTQ+ members in tech and tech adjacent over the summer called [Tea Time](http://teatime.substack.com/). This brought me a lot of love into my life and felt like collaborative therapy. It also reminded me that there is good in the world, that communities are strong because we believe in each other, and that communities grow because of shared identities. This lended naturally well because a couple of friends and I then decided to start a quasi-incubator called [Brown RISD Innovation Community (BRIC)](http://brownrisdinnovation.com/). Starting this in a pandemic, with everything virtual was...hard. We pivoted so many times and screwed up so much but I\u2019m glad that our community members stood with us through all the bumps in the road.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what happens in the new year but going into all of these initiatives and doing things I love made me take a step back and reevaluate life a little bit. So much of it so far has been doing what people expected of me: _going to a good school, studying hard, majoring in something \u201capplicable.\u201d_ And while I still am very much a stereotype in many regards, I\u2019ve started to branch out and learn what makes me happy has been an important leap I took. Maybe it\u2019s taking a rest day and reading a book I\u2019ve been meaning to catch up on. Or maybe it\u2019s focusing on supporting the LGBTQ+ community in any way I know how. Whatever it is, I hope to keep that trend going in the future.\n\n### On Friendships\n\nA lot of friendships took a toll this year. Not only was I unable to see most of my friends due to the pandemic, it solidified and destroyed some of the ones I had. Some of my friends have heard me talk about this a lot (and I listen to [podcasts](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Tm3COwfgKpkEPIVHErbIu?si=t6d4-9BhRnmkFJkVc1tDJQ) ad nauseam about this topic) but I think that those that want you in their lives made an effort and really stepped up. And those that didn\u2019t\u2026didn\u2019t. I think that it\u2019s super difficult and that lives always get in the way but I\u2019m a huge believer that anyone can prioritize reaching out if they really tried (under somewhat normal circumstances of course).\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m super appreciative of the online friends I\u2019ve made (y\u2019all know who you are and I love you) who have kept me sane and for Twitter to always throw me in the deep end.\n\n### On Relationships\n\nI am temporarily giving up on this one for the near future \ud83d\ude05\n\nA lot of things happened, and I had some of the highest highs and the lowest lows but overall, I\u2019m grateful for the friends who have stuck by my side, the organizations who are taking (or have taken) a bet on me to let me grow in their grasp, and the mentors who have shown me light and guidance no matter what is happening. Cheers to a better 2021.\n", "title": "on-2020", "href": "https://ivanzhao.me/writing/on-2020"}]
