OPENER: Start with something that really introduces you personally, especially if there is something visual about you that stands out, e.g. unusual hair color, super bushy eyebrows, a parrot on your shoulder, etc. Acknowledge it right off the bat and the audience will forget about it and pay attention to YOU.\n\n- Hey all I'm Ivan!, pronouns are he/him\n\t- If you don't me,  im a senior, and im studying apma cs which means im infinitely more obnoxious than other cs majors\n\t- some people will ask me oh are you cs? you give me cs vibes  and I have to correct them that ACTUALLY im doubling in math as well, but not pure math\n- I also have dyed hair which means that not only am I depressed, I'm also a flaming homosexual (except maybe id need to dye my hair red for that to really be true)\n- I'm chinese american,\n\t- My name Ivan is pretty significant. in chinese, Ai Wen means a love of literature and learning but in english it actually means I'm one breakdown away from dropping out of school\n\t\n\n\n\n\n3.  CHUNK 1: Topic 1. Good for this to be something personal, too. Let them get to know you!\n    1.  BIT (funny)\n    2.  BIT (funnier)\n    3.  BIT (funniest)\n\n- I was in new york over thanksgiving break, anyone else from nyc???\n\t- (pause)\n\t- I know at least one person would raise their hand because jessie's at least here\n- New york is great because there's so much diversity of culture, broadway???, and unlike brown, you can find more than 10 gay people in a room\n- New york also has a ton of fun speak easies. I was going to a bar that weekend and was looking at their menu. If you know me, you know I love (cock)tails.\n\t- That joke gets a wink\n- One particular drink that's great is the moscow mule, which is a combination of vodka and ginger beer. It's super light and refreshing. But this bar was actually serving something called the shanghai mule which I relate to because im chinese and also can't produce offspring\n\n\n- speaking of sexual endeavors, the dating life at brown is pretty terrible. \n\t- dating is worse as a gay because before I dyed my hair I was type cast as a nerdy chinese asian who studied math and cs when in reality my type was apparently skinny white dudes\n\t- You know, I was swiping on the 5 dudes at brown on tinder, (anyone on tinder), and I actually matched with this random dude from providence college! and im like, maybe ill try this see where this goes! when we met up he goes, just to let you know, I might be an axe murderer. and i go oh! super fun! what a great way to intro yourself, let me grab my keys tigher \n\t- and then one of my friends texts me asking why my location is in the water \n\t- so, of course I get sick of this and one night drunkenly set my hinge profile to boston and actually... went on a date during the week\n\t\t- crazy, I know\n\t- The date went well and i was a little drunk and I actually miss my TRAIN at 11pm and this man goes oh no! you missed your train\n\t- anyways, needless to say that most people have normal walks of shame from halfway across campus, I choose to girlboss and instead have a train of shame from boston to providence.\n\n\n\n4.  CHUNK 2: Topic 2: No need to segue between chunks. You can just start a new topic.\n    1.  BIT (funny)\n    2.  BIT (funnier)\n    3.  BIT (funniest)\n\n- so like most people at this school, I have impostor syndrome, which stemmed from the fact that I was a waitlist kid\n\t- If you don't what a waitlist is, it basically means brown looked at me and said \"no thank you\".\n\t- It also meant that brown took two tries before accepting me which is great because my parents still haven't and it's been twenty one years.\n\t- They definitely should've taken more tries on the poo statue on teh main green\n\t- Anyways, I thought that I would come to brown for learning ,andd greowth and culture. But...\n\t- Well the two thing I truly learned are two things) that good fortune is the only available super market and that guys you hook up also need two tries \n\n\n5.  CHUNK 3: Topic 3: Can be related to an earlier topic\u2026or not!\n    1.  BIT (funny)\n    2.  BIT (funnier)\n    3.  BIT (funniest)\n\n- My brother got engaged the other week \n\t- (wait for applause)\n\t- thanks for clapping! I did absolutely nothing but alright.\n- My family doesn't really know yet I'm gay, but they should've figured that out when I binge watched 20 seasons of America's next top model with my friend\n- you know, I also should've figured that out cause as a kid, I used to play heads or tails where heads, I was gay, and tails... I would flip the coin again\n- Sometimes, I wonder what my life would be like if I was striaght, cause like, during freshman and sophomore year, this girl was so obsessed with me she would call me every week. (pause) I just wish this women wasn't my mom and she stopped telling me to study medicine and go be a doctor\n\n6.  CLOSER: Could really be BIT IV D, but a callback, or just a killer joke you know ALWAYS works.\n\n- going back to the original reason that we're here, I do actually have a piece in visions!! except im colorblind so it should be called partial vision\n- it's about family, specifically my grandma and my brother. call that a \"forbidden threeway\"\n- but y'all should totally check it out and props to the rest of the eboard!\n\n\n\n\nDrop ??\n\t- If you've never met me, I'm exactly like every other east asian with dyed hair. If you have met me, I'm not like every other girl.

So many people just _eat_, and they never think about what they're putting into their mouth and tasting.\n\nI say stop, slow down, and _design the bite_\u2014set up your plate up so you can be deliberate about what you're going to eat with what. Every forkful should be amazing, and every one should be different.\n\nYou can put a little more kale on your fork, for example, or a little bit less sweet potato, or a little bit more steak. If there's extra kale in your mouth, the bite's going to be different. What does the sweet potato remind you of? What does the kale feel like to eat? What do you want in your next bite?\n\nThat constant training and testing of your palate is an education for your mind that you'll apply when you start flowing in the kitchen, because your palate is part of what makes you a great cook. Everyone has a mental palate\u2014you just have to exercise it.\n\nWhen it has, and you\u2019ve learned some techniques, it will eventually feel like you\u2019re floating above your body when you\u2019re in the kitchen. You\u2019ll be able to truly flow when you\u2019re making a crispy egg\u2014because you know the cadence of exactly how to do it. Instead of worrying about the movements, you're in your head tasting the egg before it's even served.\n\nFor me, \u2018design the bite\u2019 is a beautiful lesson that keeps growing as you keep thinking about it\u2014cooking, tasting, and learning.", "title": "Designing the Bite"}, {"id": "ob6", "tokens": {"in": 1, "her": 1, "article": 1, "for": 1, "cjr": 1, "watson": 1, "had": 1, "identified": 1, "some": 2, "tics": 1, "of": 3, "tech": 2, "writing": 1, "moral": 1, "panic": 1, "technological": 1, "determinism": 1, "the": 4, "pathologizing": 1, "consumer": 1, "behavior": 1, "and": 2, "appeal": 1, "to": 3, "readerly": 1, "anxiety": 1, "new": 1, "wave": 1, "criticism": 1, "exhibited": 1, "these": 1, "tendencies": 1, "too": 1, "media": 1, "s": 1, "intensified": 1, "scrutiny": 1, "was": 1, "well": 1, "deserved": 1, "overdue": 1, "others": 1, "even": 1, "investigative": 1, "reporting": 1, "looked": 1, "like": 1, "personally": 1, "motivated": 1, "backlash": 1}, "content": "In her article for _CJR_, Watson had identified some tics of tech writing: moral panic, technological determinism, the pathologizing of consumer behavior, and the appeal to readerly anxiety.

(We should also suppose that the relevant surroundings are exactly the same as for Earth; it revolves around a star that appears to be exactly like our sun, and so on). On Twin Earth, there is a Twin equivalent of every person and thing here on Earth. The one difference between the two planets is that there is no water on Twin Earth. In its place there is a liquid that is superficially identical, but is chemically different, being composed not of H2O, but rather of some more complicated formula which we abbreviate as \"XYZ\". The Twin Earthlings who refer to their language as \"English\" call XYZ \"water\". Finally, we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago, when the residents of Earth and Twin Earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called \"water\" were H2O and XYZ respectively. The experience of people on Earth with water and that of those on Twin Earth with XYZ would be identical.\n\n  \n\nNow the question arises: when an Earthling (or Oscar for simplicity's sake) and his twin on Twin Earth say 'water' do they mean the same thing? (The twin is also called 'Oscar' on his own planet, of course. Indeed, the inhabitants of that planet call their own planet 'Earth'. For convenience, we refer to this putative planet as 'Twin Earth', and extend this naming convention to the objects and people that inhabit it, in this case referring to Oscar's twin as Twin Oscar.) _Ex hypothesi_, they are in identical psychological states, with the same thoughts, feelings, etc. Yet, at least according to Putnam, when Oscar says 'water', the term refers to H2O, whereas when Twin Oscar says 'water' it refers to XYZ. The result of this is that the contents of a person's brain are not sufficient to determine the reference of terms they use, as one must also examine the [causal history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal-historical_theory_of_reference \"Causal-historical theory of reference\") that led to this individual acquiring the term. (Oscar, for instance, learned the word 'water' in a world filled with H2O, whereas Twin Oscar learned 'water' in a world filled with XYZ.)\n\n#semantic-externalism", "title": "Twin Earth"}, {"id": "ob12", "tokens": {"https": 1}, "content": "\n- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos?fbclid=IwAR0Dun9x0G9-QlG6AmEimVUcS59f66A9urp1Ym8hF0nFRZneqx_XhdY2m-U](Mother of all demos)", "title": "Personal Computing Examples"}, {"id": "ob13", "tokens": {"https": 1}, "content": "https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-illusion-of-explanatory-depth/", "title": "Illusion of Explanatory Depth"}, {"id": "ob14", "tokens": {"https": 2}, "content": "https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk\n- https://www.daltonmaag.com/library/aktiv-grotesk", "title": "Fonts I like"}, {"id": "ob15", "tokens": {"alchemy": 1}, "content": "- [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com)\n- ", "title": "Crypto Companies"}, {"id": "ob16", "tokens": {"episodic": 1, "vs": 1, "semantic": 1, "memory": 2, "rif": 1, "retrieval": 2, "induced": 1, "forgetting": 1, "everytime": 1, "you": 1, "retireve": 1, "smth": 1, "a": 1, "different": 1, "is": 1, "forgotten": 1, "in": 1, "the": 1, "process": 1, "of": 1, "memex": 1}, "content": "- episodic vs semantic memory\n- RIF (Retrieval Induced Forgetting)\n\t- everytime you retireve smth, a different memory is forgotten in the process of retrieval \n\n\n- MEMEX", "title": "Memory"}, {"id": "ob17", "tokens": {"designers": 1, "daniel": 1, "eden": 1, "jordan": 1, "singer": 1, "david": 1, "hoang": 1, "molly": 1, "miekle": 1, "artists": 1, "titsay": 1, "random": 1, "list": 1, "from": 1, "name": 1, "drops": 1, "cas": 1, "holman": 1}, "content": "## Designers\n- [Daniel Eden](https://daneden.me) \n- Jordan Singer\n- David Hoang\n- Molly Miekle\n\n\n## Artists\n- Titsay\n\n\n\n\nRandom list from name drops:\n- [Cas Holman](https://casholman.com/about)", "title": "List of People I find Inspiring"}, {"id": "ob18", "tokens": {"i": 2, "want": 1, "to": 2, "be": 1, "able": 1, "name": 1, "the": 1, "things": 1, "that": 1, "care": 1, "about": 1, "this": 1, "currently": 1, "includes": 1, "creative": 1, "personal": 1, "computing": 1, "how": 1, "can": 1, "we": 1, "augment": 1, "individuals": 1}, "content": "I want to be able to name the things that I care about.
