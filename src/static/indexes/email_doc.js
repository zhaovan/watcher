Besties!!\n\nThe next couple of week's essays are inspired by deep dives into different spaces as I'm ~potentially~ evaluating startup ideas. Why am I deciding to do this? Who the fuck knows.\n\n> This week's essay is inspired by community platforms and community, specifically the [orbit model](https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model) created by [Orbit](http://orbit.love) and this podcast from [TKP](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OtDdWKWKNmjoGkAbdKj8N?si=bafd390e070a4a77)\n\nCommunity has been a hot buzzword for the past year. Given that the world has absolutely gone to shit and that everyone has been stuck at home, people have been yearning for people to connect with. Communities have sprung up in so many directions, from students [looking to break into design](https://www.designbuddies.community/) and [VC](https://www.genzvcs.com/) (yikes) to more wholesome groups like [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com) and [rating dogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates). As someone who's had the opportunity to be a part of a few groups and scale others, seeing the orbit model feels like such a dehumanized take on how we as humans should bond. That's not to say it's not important. We spent the past couple of weeks figuring out how to put KPI's on community (tldr: I still don't know what they should be) so being able to quantify how people are interacting and thinking together is important.\n\nHowever, what's more significant than the pure numbers of community is the notion of connectivity. In an episode on The Knowledge Project with [Noreena Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noreena_Hertz), she discusses the loneliness crisis. In its essence, technology has resulted in a net negative for how connected we feel towards people. Social media drives up anxiety and depression rates among teenagers, some people even quoting that they feel like they are unloved and did something wrong when their post on instagram gets only a couple likes. People are flocking to joining Slack groups at length. Humans aren't infinitely scalable. We don't have indefinite time, attention, and lord knows our memory sucks. Memorizing people's names is already a challenge. How are we supposed to remember people in over fifty communities?\n\nThe short answer is that we aren't. In a world that is overflowing with information, people have to be choosier with their time. What to spend it on and who to spend it on. That's why building communities at scale is difficult. This is for two main reasons. \n\nThe first is that in a sense, there are reverse network effects. As the community scales, there is less time spent meaningfully between each 1:1 interaction. I fundamentally believe that the relationships are driven from spending meaningful time between two people, that hanging out in a group doesn't necessarily mean that you're close to everyone. As such, the individuals in the group might spin out, or might not hang with the rest of the group.\n\nThe second, which is similar, is that there will always be niche groups that can be broken down within each community. Simply having a shared identity in \"VC\" (whatever the fuck that means) doesn't mean that you'll be interested in the same topics, come from the same background, or have the same values. As someone who values intersectional identity and reads a lot of diasporic novels, its become increasingly clear that having shared experiences in how you were raised has created some of the strongest bonds. \n\n## Short Aside because I like graphs LMFAO\n\nIf we want to formally describe it, we can say that the strength of the graph is dependent on how far the graph is from being complete, and the percentage of nodes that are connected to each other. \n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Complete_graph_K7.svg/1200px-Complete_graph_K7.svg.png)\n\nObviously, this is not possible. If this were the case, everyone in the world would be connected. LinkedIn wouldn't exist and there wouldn't be niches in Twitter. As such, we're left with the idea of strongly connected subcomponents, which, by definition, are subgraphs in which it is possible to start at a vertex and reach any other vertex in the subgraph. Networks are typically seen this way. LinkedIn leverages this fact by telling you how many mutual connections you have.\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Scc-1.svg/1200px-Scc-1.svg.png)\n\nBut, if we're evaluating a community, one KPI to optimize is *minimizing* the number of strongly connected subcomponents that we have. By taking a poll of who knows who and how they feel about their friendships in the group, we can create a representation that we can algorithmically solve. \n\nIf you've made it here, thanks for listening to the rambles and best of luck with the week! If anything doesn't make sense, let me know! I'm trying to write more so I'll probably stumble a lot tbh.\n\n---\n\nOther stuff I'm up to:\n\n- Going to NYC for two weeks at the end of July / start of August.

This week's short essay drop is on college and admissions, inspired by the biweekly [Reboot](http://joinreboot.org/) fellowship hang, watching [Operation Varsity Blues](https://www.vogue.com/article/netflix-operation-varsity-blues-documentary), and [this short essay](https://www.inquiremore.com/p/we-should-get-rid-of-college-admissions) from Inqiure on how removing standardized testing from college apps increases inequality (it's a great short read).\n\n## On College\n\nWatching the mockumentary made me relive all of the emotions that went through the college admissions process. All of the stress of applications, the constant strain of realizing that everything in your life sort of led up to this point (spoiler: it didn't), and the devastating feeling of rejection. If you haven't checked it out on Netflix, I highly recommend it. It goes by in a whirlwind and hits you in the face with how messed up the application process is, (and also higher education), and the society that we currently live in. Higher education is singularly approaching a world where acceptance rates are dropping, people are still leveraging backdoor techniques to get in (if you have millions, you're set), and yet the value is increasingly questionable as it sends people thousands of dollars into debt. \n\nCollege has turned from a place where people freely explore their interests to one that serves are more of a vocational training program. Even as schools such as Brown implement the open curriculum so that students have the freedom of choice, social and parental pressures (ever heard the phrase that college is the best four years of your life? It's not btw) force you to randomly optimize with zero knowledge of what the real world is like. As such, many students end up floundering around the first couple of years before figuring out what they want to do in senior year (or have a dedicated 15 year plan if you're premed).\n\nIf you've been on Twitter at all, there's a ton of discourse on unbundling higher education . If you're familiar with the software landscape (or history broadly), you'll recognize that this is somewhat bullshit. Things come in cycles. We bundle. Then unbundle. Find a notetaking app that does it all. Then fall in love with one that does something really well. Over and over again until we die. As such, a more interesting question is how can we best adjust the college and learning experience to best fit with how we are as humans. \n\nStanford [d.school](http://d.school) digs into this idea in their [project](https://dschool.stanford.edu/unchartedterritory). One interesting concept is the idea of an Open Loop university, that you get four years of college whenever you want them, when you need them. From an algorithms perspective, it's interesting. We're treating life as a greedy algorithm where we want to maximize our learnings/goals/growth whenever we have the chance. Thus, if we're 30, and want to go back to school for a year, we can. It increases optionality, increases flexibility, and allows us to take classes that are fulfilling and in line with where we are in life, rather than taking an easy humanities class just to get a GPA booster.\n\nOne of the other aspects that people really enjoy about college is the opportunity to meet people their age who go through some of the same struggles. However, Open Loop provides this opportunity and more. Not only are you able to meet people further in their career, you interact with a wider range of human beings, and are also able to chat in a more informal way. No more awkward LinkedIn DM's or cold emails asking if you could \"pick their brain\" about their job for 15 minutes in a thinly veiled attempt to be recruited. \n\nThis idea is super interesting as the world moves towards a more decentralized society. With the rise of the remote work, optionality has higher value for people who have felt locked into their job. These ideas should translate and start from where people think about their careers: college.\n\nThanks so much for hearing some of my musings and if you ever have thoughts, would love to chat about them.\n\nOther things I'm up to:\n\n- Started working at Blend as an intern on the Consumer Banking Team!\n- In LA for a couple weeks then heading off to SF\n- Eating too much ice cream", "title": "thoughts-on-college", "href": "https://buttondown.email/zhaovan/archive/thoughts-on-college"}, {"id": "em2", "tokens": {"hey": 1, "friendos": 1, "happy": 1, "monday": 2, "hope": 2, "you": 13, "had": 4, "a": 15, "restful": 1, "weekend": 1, "and": 13, "enjoyed": 1, "the": 30, "outdoors": 1, "indoors": 1, "doors": 1, "whatever": 1, "your": 3, "vibe": 1, "is": 8, "this": 4, "week": 4, "s": 7, "essay": 2, "inspired": 1, "by": 2, "book": 4, "in": 14, "h": 3, "chatting": 1, "with": 5, "vinay": 2, "from": 4, "two": 2, "sigma": 1, "for": 6, "prism": 1, "scrolling": 1, "through": 3, "twitter": 1, "on": 6, "appreciation": 1, "i": 16, "spent": 1, "past": 2, "half": 3, "reading": 2, "michelle": 1, "zauner": 1, "if": 4, "haven": 1, "t": 3, "checked": 1, "it": 10, "out": 1, "highly": 1, "recommend": 1, "to": 20, "be": 3, "quite": 1, "honest": 2, "pretty": 1, "heavy": 1, "was": 4, "sniffling": 1, "plane": 1, "ride": 1, "la": 1, "sf": 2, "physically": 1, "put": 1, "down": 1, "couple": 1, "times": 1, "re": 5, "not": 2, "familiar": 1, "describes": 1, "author": 1, "experience": 1, "her": 4, "family": 2, "specifically": 1, "as": 5, "korean": 1, "american": 1, "child": 1, "who": 1, "grew": 1, "up": 3, "farmlands": 1, "portland": 1, "mother": 1, "recently": 1, "passed": 1, "cancer": 1, "narrates": 1, "thoughts": 1, "feelings": 1, "regrets": 1, "understandings": 1, "she": 1, "navigates": 1, "own": 1, "grief": 1, "beautifully": 1, "written": 1, "little": 3, "haunting": 1, "stories": 1, "like": 2, "these": 3, "hit": 1, "too": 1, "close": 1, "home": 1, "forces": 1, "reconsider": 1, "worldview": 1, "that": 19, "everything": 1, "life": 4, "isn": 1, "always": 1, "roses": 1, "unforgiving": 1, "punishing": 1, "but": 4, "also": 2, "makes": 1, "consider": 1, "things": 3, "did": 1, "work": 1, "many": 1, "of": 9, "us": 1, "opportunities": 1, "we": 6, "were": 1, "given": 2, "chance": 1, "chat": 1, "iyengar": 1, "other": 2, "day": 1, "already": 1, "know": 2, "what": 3, "thinking": 1, "god": 1, "ivan": 1, "please": 1, "find": 1, "personality": 1, "besides": 1, "venture": 1, "my": 2, "response": 1, "m": 1, "trying": 1, "anyways": 1, "one": 1, "questions": 1, "asked": 1, "him": 3, "which": 1, "shamelessly": 1, "stole": 1, "asking": 1, "nicest": 1, "thing": 1, "someone": 1, "has": 1, "done": 1, "he": 4, "promptly": 1, "responded": 1, "appreciative": 2, "his": 2, "queer": 2, "poc": 1, "first": 1, "generation": 1, "immigrant": 1, "opportunity": 2, "live": 4, "best": 1, "pursue": 1, "cares": 1, "about": 3, "have": 3, "optionality": 1, "choose": 1, "something": 1, "else": 1, "cried": 1, "bit": 1, "at": 1, "end": 1, "living": 2, "asian": 1, "hard": 1, "constantly": 1, "conflicted": 1, "between": 1, "being": 2, "able": 2, "because": 1, "sacrifice": 1, "parents": 3, "made": 3, "give": 1, "thrive": 1, "resentful": 1, "fact": 1, "they": 2, "won": 1, "understand": 1, "jokes": 2, "are": 1, "uncomfortable": 1, "there": 1, "so": 3, "much": 2, "divide": 1, "politics": 1, "some": 2, "topics": 1, "people": 2, "post": 2, "tiktok": 1, "society": 3, "comprised": 1, "diasporic": 1, "communities": 1, "where": 1, "go": 1, "mart": 1, "ranch": 1, "99": 1, "or": 3, "ethnic": 1, "supermarkets": 1, "can": 2, "relive": 1, "memories": 1, "our": 3, "cooking": 1, "food": 1, "kitchen": 1, "peeling": 1, "snacks": 1, "learning": 1, "their": 1, "childhoods": 1, "grow": 1, "deeply": 1, "unfamiliar": 1, "values": 1, "shift": 1, "keep": 1, "coming": 1, "back": 1, "emotions": 1, "frustration": 1, "thankfulness": 1, "someday": 1, "together": 1, "harmony": 1, "mind": 1, "ve": 2, "here": 1, "thanks": 1, "sorry": 1, "very": 1, "feels": 1, "reflection": 1, "been": 1, "move": 1, "summer": 1, "area": 1, "recs": 1, "should": 1, "do": 1, "lem": 1, "me": 1, "currently": 1, "working": 1, "bot": 1, "daniel": 1, "craig": 1, "every": 1, "yes": 1, "stupid": 1, "no": 1, "will": 1, "explain": 1, "further": 1, "until": 1, "finish": 1}, "content": "### Hey friendos!!\n\nHappy Monday! Hope you had a restful weekend and enjoyed the outdoors, indoors, doors, whatever your vibe is. This week\u2019s essay is inspired by the book /Crying in H Mart/, chatting with Vinay from Two Sigma for [Prism](https://prism.dormroomfund.com), and scrolling through Twitter.\n\n## On Appreciation\nI spent the past week and a half reading /Crying in H Mart/ by Michelle Zauner. If you haven\u2019t checked it out, I highly recommend it. To be quite honest, it\u2019s pretty heavy. I was sniffling on the plane ride from LA to SF and had to physically put the book down a couple times. If you\u2019re not familiar with it, the book describes the author\u2019s experience with her family, specifically as a half Korean half American child who grew up in the farmlands in Portland. Her mother had recently passed from cancer and the book narrates through her thoughts, feelings, regrets, and understandings as she navigates through her own grief. It\u2019s beautifully written and a little haunting.\n\nStories like these hit a little too close to home. It forces you to reconsider your worldview, that everything in life isn\u2019t always roses, that life is unforgiving and punishing. But it also makes you consider the things that did work for you. And for many of us, that\u2019s the opportunities that we were given.\n\nI had the chance to chat with Vinay Iyengar the other day. I already know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cgod Ivan, please find a personality besides venture capital.\u201d And my response to that is that I\u2019M TRYING. But anyways. One of the questions that I asked him (which I shamelessly stole from /Invest like the Best/) is asking him what the nicest thing someone has done for him. He promptly responded that he was appreciative of his family, that as a queer POC first generation immigrant, he was given the opportunity to live his best life, pursue the things he cares about, and have the optionality to choose something else. To be honest, I cried a little bit at the end. Living as a queer asian is hard. You\u2019re constantly conflicted between being appreciative of the life that you\u2019re able to live because of the sacrifice that your parents made to give you the opportunity to thrive but also resentful of the fact that they won\u2019t be able to understand you, that the hetero-normalized jokes being made are uncomfortable, that there\u2019s so much divide in politics on some of these topics some people post jokes about it on TikTok.\n\nWe live in a society. A society comprised of people living in diasporic communities, where we go to H Mart, Ranch 99, or other ethnic supermarkets so that we can relive the memories we have with our parents, cooking food in the kitchen, peeling snacks or learning about their childhoods. But as we grow up in a society deeply unfamiliar to our parents and our values shift, I keep coming back to these two emotions: frustration and thankfulness. Someday, I hope that they can live together in harmony in my mind.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it here, thanks for reading! Sorry I was very much in the feels this past week so this week\u2019s essay is a reflection of that.\n\nThings that I\u2019ve been up to:\n\n* Move to SF for the summer! If you\u2019re in the area or have recs on what I should do, lemme know!\n* Currently working on a bot to post Daniel Craig every monday. Yes this is stupid.

Happy Sunday!\n\nThanks for subscribing! This is a side project I started to motivate myself to write more and put words to a lot of the stray thoughts in my head. The first week's thoughts are on habit building, graciously inspired by  by [this essay](https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change) from James Clear and this podcast episode with BJ Fogg from [The Knowledge Project](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3QjLxStaZNWS4n5zCfxcCc?si=e6ac10fc223a4a6e).\n\n## Habits\n\nIn his book, Atomic Habits, James Clear defines the habit stages as follows:\n\n![](https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Four-stages-of-habit-e1537283892596-1200x583.png)\n\nWhat we know as a habit is actually a progression from some sort of stimulus, thought process and neural pathway, actual action, and the corresponding reward. Recognizing that habits are comprised of multiple parts means that we can actively break them down to figure out ways to build better habits and how to stop bad ones.\n\nTo understand this framework, let's take a quintessential example of something we've probably experienced during the pandemic, entering the kitchen. Let's say you just took a break from a day of grinding, you're feeling a bit bored, and you're just going to refill your water bottle. **Babam**, you see the fridge and suddenly you think, *wow, the ice cream I bought the other day seems really good right now*. You go over to the freezer, pop open the drawer, and start devouring the delicious, frozen goodness. (On a side note, I've recently been exposed to the world of Jeni's and Nick's and they're both fantastic, highly recomend checking them out). Afterwards, you're nourished, satisfied, and, if you're anything like me, probably tossing the pint out because you finished it.\n\nNeedless to say, this probably happens multiple times a week (or even multiple times a day). And it follows the exact same framework that James Clear has established:\n\n1.  **Cue**: You enter the kitchen\n2.  **Craving**: You want a snack (or in this case, ice cream)\n3.  **Response**: You go over to the freezer and eat the ice cream\n4.  **Reward**: Your brain gets that good good dopamine\n\nAnd so if you're doing this every day, for at least a year, you can see how fast it becomes instinct, that you're not even thinking through the steps and do them immediately.\n\n### So what?\n\nLet's say you're on a goal to try to eat less ice cream (or at least eat something else). We can put interceptors at each step to inhibit it, making it more difficult to complete. At each step, asking yourself the questions\n\n1. How can I make it unobvious?\n2. How can I make it unattractive?\n3. How can I make it difficult?\n4. How can I make it unsatisfying?\n\nPurposefully designing your life to increase (or decrease) friction means that it'll be easier (or harder) to do tasks. For example, maybe one way of decreasing your access to the ice cream is shoving it in the back of the freezer. Or not even buying it in the first place. That way, if you decide that you want ice cream, the amount of friction (driving to the store, paying for the food, coming back) is noticeably larger, making it much more difficult to happen.\n\n\n## Things I am up to\n\n- Finished reading Abolish Silicon Valley (which you can peep my review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48760481-abolish-silicon-valley)\n- Still chugging through [Prism](http://prism.dormroomfund.com) work. It's super tiring but also extremely motivating.\n\n## Parting Thoughts\n\nIf you got here and you're thinking, *god I hope this isn't another newsletter telling me how I should be better*, you're absolutely right. It's not a newsletter telling you how to be better. Because you're already amazing! But in all seriousness, thinking around how we can decrease/increase fiction in our lives, whether its through software or things we do in real life, can fundamentally change how we work on a day basis.", "title": "on-habits-and-procrastination", "href": "https://buttondown.email/zhaovan/archive/on-habits-and-procrastination"}]
